# deployment-testing

This repository is a repository to demonstrate deployment on

* [github Pages](https://pages.github.com/),
* [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) and
* [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/).

I showed how to deploy to each of these platforms in my Twitch livestream. I will cut and upload VODs tutorials on YouTube and will link them here when they're published.
